# AI Voice Assistant for Afiqa ü§ñüí¨

## Project Documentation

### The Problem 
My sister Afiqa has a condition called "cant shut her mouth" Symptoms include:
- Non-stop talking about her school crush 
- Asking me "Does he like me?" non stop
- Analyzing every microscopic interaction with said crush
- Using me as her personal relationship therapist 24/7

### The Solution üõ†Ô∏è
After suffering through months of crush analysis sessions, I decided to build her an AI companion in **under 1 hour** using ElevenLabs Conversational AI. 

**Goal:** Redirect her yapping to an AI that actually has infinite patience.

### Implementation ‚ö°
Built using:
- Python 3.13
- ElevenLabs Conversational AI API

### First Test Results üìä

**Time to deployment:** 1 hour  
**Time until first crush question:** 30 seconds  

**Her first conversation with the AI:**
```
Agent: Hello Afika! I'm your AI companion...

User: What do you think if a guy suddenly came to me and gave me candy and go away just like that?

Agent: That's quite a random encounter! It could mean a few things...

User: That guy was my crush, and he knew that I have a crush on him.

Agent: Okay, that definitely adds a new layer to the situation!

User: Uh, does it mean he likes me back or something?

Agent: It's hard to say for sure if he likes you back just from this one action, but it's definitely a positive sign!
```

**Mission Accomplished!** 

**Built with and by a tired brother who just wanted to code in peace**

### Technical Notes 
- Voice commands include shutdown options (because even AI needs breaks)
- Conversational personality designed for maximum patience
- Handles relationship questions with therapist-level empathy
- Successfully redirected 100% of crush-related conversations

**Success Rate:** 10/10 would build again for other yapping siblings
